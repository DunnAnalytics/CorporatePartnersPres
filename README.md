# CorporatePartnersPres

In my undergraduate business analytics capstone course, I worked on this presentation with a primary goal: to communicate data-driven insights effectively. Since most of the analysis was already completed for us, the challenge lay in transforming raw findings into compelling visual stories that resonated with a business audience. I used Tableau to craft clear and engaging data visualizations that highlighted key takeaways. My work led to me being selected as one of a few students to present to corporate partners of the Business Analytics Advisory Board. Through this experience, I enhanced both my public speaking skills and my ability to create meaningful visualizations in Tableau.
