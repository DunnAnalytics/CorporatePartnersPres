# **Corporate Partners Presentation ðŸŽ¤ðŸ“Š**

### **Overview**  
In my undergraduate **Business Analytics Capstone** course, I developed this presentation to effectively **communicate data-driven insights** to a business audience. Since most of the analysis was already provided, my focus was on transforming raw findings into **engaging visual stories** using **Tableau**.  

I was honored to be selected as one of a few students to present to the **corporate partners of the Business Analytics Advisory Board**. This experience strengthened my skills in:  
âœ… **Public Speaking & Presentation** â€“ Delivering insights clearly and confidently.  
âœ… **Data Visualization in Tableau** â€“ Designing intuitive, impactful dashboards.  
âœ… **Storytelling with Data** â€“ Translating complex findings into meaningful narratives.
